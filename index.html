                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! 👋🏿 My name is Mustafa Berry, and I’m a 3rd-semester Computer Science student at DHA Suffa University. So far, I’ve built simple projects in C and Java, and now I’m diving into web development with this Portfolio Page as my latest project! 🐐</p>
                <p> I'm particularly passionate about low-latency programming and quanitative development. The idea of optimizing systems to achieve ultra-fast performance fascintes me, and I aspire to work in fields like high-frequency trading and algorithmic optimization.</p>
                <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy engaging in spirited debates with friends, competing in chess tournaments, and getting lost in books. My reading interests range from the global economy to the fascinating world of Nuclear Negotiation. Have a book recommendation? Let me know in the contact section—I’m always looking for my next great read!</p>
                <p>Got suggestions or just want to say hi? Head over to the contact section---I'd love to connect!</p>
